    <h2> 
        History of Redlining 
    </h2>
    <p>
         Redlining came from FDRâ€™s loan program in 1930, and these loans were to FINANCE HOMES. The government decides who received loans, by separating neighborhoods into red and green zones. Now, how the loaning process worked is, if you lived in the green, hooray! You earned money, if you lived in the red; no money. The government purposely outlined the red neighboorhoods because there lived the majority of African Americans and other people of color lived. Homeowners were even encouraged not to let African Americans and other poc into the green neighborhoods.

        Does it still happen today???
    </h2>
    <p>
        Although redlining is now illegal, neighborhoods that were redlined in the past face many more problems like pollution, fewer resources, and worse health outcomes. Even though it's gone we still see its impact today.
