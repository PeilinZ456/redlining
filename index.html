            History of Redlining 
        </h2>
        <p>
            Redlining came from FDRâ€™s loan program in 1930, and these loans were to FINANCE HOMES. 
            The government decides who received loans, by separating neighborhoods into red and green zones. 
            Now, how the loaning process worked is, if you lived in the green, hooray! You earned money, if you lived in the red; no money. 
            The government purposely outlined the red neighboorhoods because there lived the majority of African Americans and other people of color lived. 
            Homeowners were even encouraged not to let African Americans and other poc into the green neighborhoods.

            The FHA (Federal Housing Administration) is a
            United States Government agency that helps make homeownership 
            more accessible to a wider range of people than it did when redlining was legal.

                Does it still happen today?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Although redlining is now illegal, neighborhoods that were redlined in the past face many more problems like pollution, 
                fewer resources, and even worse health outcomes. Even though redlining no longer exists, we still see the impact it left on our communities today.

                What can we do to Combat the Effects of Redling? 
            </h2>
            <p>
                Steps recommended to reverse the effects of redlining include studying it's history and putting responsible, active people in power.
                By doing this we may prevent the past from repeating and we'll have people properly revising policies that will lead to the best outcome for the majority of a population
                than just a selected few.
